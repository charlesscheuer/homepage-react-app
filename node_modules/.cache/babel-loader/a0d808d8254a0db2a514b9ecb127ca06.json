Charles was a Developer on our customer systems team for which I was a Product Manager. The team is responsible for our client facing websites, landing pages, search, and account experiences. In short, Charles was an amazing teammate, an impressive individual contributor, and any company would be lucky to have him on their team. Over the course of the summer Charles ramp was impressively quick. He quickly integrated with the team and started contributing meaningful features in only a week or so. His accomplishments include rebuilding the home listing details pages, building a new tour booking client flow, performance optimizations, and improving our mobile-web map. Each of these features were delivered with a sense of craftsmanship and polish - from minute animations of text and buttons to fluid page transitions. The things that really stuck out to me were Charles work ethic and his customer empathy. Charles was eager to make an impact and jump in on random bugs and projects throughout the whole summer. He worked diligently and collaboratively to get projects done on tight deadlines helping drive implementation discussions to arrive at the best solutions. He became my go-to engineer for quick fixes - able to quickly root cause, devise solutions and deploy. But -- and what I really appreciated as a Product Manager, was Charles sense of customer empathy. Often times Charles would think through the product and customer flows as he was working through the project and propose enhancements & improvements. Any company would be lucky to have to have Charles on their team.\\\"\"), React.createElement(\"h4\", {\n        class: \"portfolio_subhead\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 70\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, \"Alexis Okamura \\u2013 Software Engineer @ Flyhomes\"), React.createElement(\"p\", {\n        class: \"portfolio_paragraph\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 73\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, \"\\\"While working at Flyhomes I had the chance to work directly with Charles.

Charles was a self-starter, quick at learning our tech stack and was always eager to help out whenever he could. When facing roadblocks he knew the right questions to ask and needed little direction to move forward.

the summer of 2019 at\n        Flyhomes. Charles was a Developer on our customer systems team for which\n        I was a Product Manager. The team is responsible for our client facing\n        websites, landing pages, search, and account experiences. In short,\n        Charles was an amazing teammate, an impressive individual contributor,\n        and any company would be lucky to have him on their team. Over the\n        course of the summer Charles ramp was impressively quick. He quickly\n        integrated with the team and started contributing meaningful features in\n        only a week or so. His accomplishments include rebuilding the home\n        listing details pages, building a new tour booking client flow,\n        performance optimizations, and improving our mobile-web map. Each of\n        these features were delivered with a sense of craftsmanship and polish -\n        from minute animations of text and buttons to fluid page transitions.\n        The things that really stuck out to me were Charles work ethic and his\n        customer empathy. Charles was eager to make an impact and jump in on\n        random bugs and projects throughout the whole summer. He worked\n        diligently and collaboratively to get projects done on tight deadlines\n        helping drive implementation discussions to arrive at the best\n        solutions. He became my go-to engineer for quick fixes - able to quickly\n        root cause, devise solutions and deploy. But -- and what I really\n        appreciated as a Product Manager, was Charles sense of customer empathy.\n        Often times Charles would think through the product and customer flows\n        as he was working through the project and propose enhancements &\n        improvements.

Charles was\n        a self-starter, quick at learning our tech stack and was always eager to\n        help out whenever he could.
